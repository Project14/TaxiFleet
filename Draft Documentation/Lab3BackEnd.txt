This assumes that the server is Ubuntu. We will be using Apache and SQLite.
	
	• Starting Apache:
		○ To install Apache (if it is not installed already), run:
			§ sudo apt-get install apache2
		○ In order to start Apache, run:
			§ sudo service apache2 start
		○ In order to stop Apache, run:
			§ sudo service apache2 stop
		○ In order to restart Apache, run:
			§ Sudo service apache2 restart
		○ In order to check Apache, run:
			§ Sudo service apache2 status
		○ NOTE: after changes to Apache configuration, the server must be restarted
		○ Configuring the server involves editing the configuration files (Contained in /etc/apache2/):
			§ apache2.conf
				□ The main config file. It pieces the other referenced files together  to determine the server configuration
			§ ports.conf
				□ This determines the ports that the server uses to listen for 
			§ mods-enabled/ (and mods-available/)
				□ The configuration files apply to installed modules
			§ conf-enabled/ (and conf-available/)
				□ These configuration files manage global configuration
				□ serve-cgi-bin.conf allows configuration for cgi scripts
			§ sites-enabled/ (and sites-available/)
				□ This allows for configuration per website. Typically, only one website is used per server, but multiple websites are allowed. WitsCabs uses 1 website.
				□ The default config file is: 000-default.conf
				□ Ensure that the DocumentRoot property is set to /var/www/html
				
	• Starting SQLite:
		○ To install SQLite, run:
			§ sudo apt-get install sqlite3
		○ To ensure that SQLite is running, run:
			§ Sqlite3
	• Running Queries:
		○ Run .import
