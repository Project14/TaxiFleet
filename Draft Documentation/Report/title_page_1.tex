\section{PROJECT OVERVIEW}
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\subsection{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The WitsCABS company owns a fleet of taxi-cabs and employs drivers for customer transportation within a city. The city is demarcated into service zones with a single taxi-stand in each service zone. Cab drivers wait for clients at their closest taxi-stand. Each driver has a smartphone, embedded with a GPS, maps and navigational tracking and access to the WitsCabs web application. A centralised Dispatch Control Centre (DCC) receives calls from customers and processes the new requests. WitsCABS requires the software application to organise their taxi-fleet, coordinate drivers and manage new job requests.

\subsection{Project Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create the software requirements specification
\item Create the design documentation for front and back ends
\item Sprint planning  and retrospective for front and back ends
\item Implementation of prototype modules for the front end interfaces
\item Implementation of prototype back-end modules
\item Implementation of an Agile management technique
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stakeholders}
The project stakeholders are divided into Users, Developers, the Project Manager and the Scrum Master. The respective stakeholders and their roles are documented below.
\subsubsection{Users}
Users are categorised into:
\begin{itemize}
\item Drivers
\item DCC agents
\item Customers
\end{itemize} 
Drivers operate the taxi-cabs, are assigned jobs and pick up and deliver customers. They have access to a driver-specific front-end interface of the WitsCABS application and are able to specify when they accept a job or are on their way as well as state when they have completed a job. Drivers have access to the WitsCABS application through a smart-phone. They also have access to GPS and map navigation and are under navigational tracking. \\\\

DCC agents operate the WitsCABS call centre and have computer access to a DCC-specific interface of the WitsCABS application. They have the ability to add new clients to the database and can view active jobs. \\\\

Customers phone in to the DCC and provide their details, current location and destination. They are assigned a driver, told a likely departure time and given a cost fort heir journey.

\subsubsection{Developers}
Developers of the WitsCABS application are responsible for the front and back end implementation as well as documentation for the system. The developers are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Frederick Nieuwoudt (front end)
\item Danielle Winter (front end)
\item Stephen Friedman (back end)
\item Sello Molele (back end)
\end{itemize} 
Frederick Nieuwoudt and Danielle Winter implemented and documented the prototype front end for the system using \textit{angular.js} and \textit{Twitter Bootstrap}. A pair programming approach was used for the implementation.\\\\
